    As a developer on a team
b stability and open communication
So That everyone feels safe, heard, and respected.

I believe when team members feel respected and have a sense of belonging and ownership to a project, that they are more likely to contribute positively.
These positive contributions help the team move forward together.
When we are together, we can assess roadblocks more effectively and make greater progress. 2 heads are better than 1, and many hands make light work. We all have particular skills that are useful and when those skills are recognized and encouraged, team members can contribute better to the overall goal.
Commentary/Narrative/Background

I am a type 9, wing 2 ‚òÆÔ∏è as per this cool free test (& if you are familiar with Myers Brigg, I am an ENFP).
This means that I desire stability and peace in relationships with others and myself. I do not enjoy conflict. I believe that if we are proactive in our communications that we can set and recognize boundaries with one another, and the more we recognize and respect each other's boundaries (as well as our own), the less conflict we find ourselves in. I enjoy helping others and coming up with solutions to problems. I would say my strength on a team is being open-minded and willing to collaborate.

I tend to be malleable on a team and fit in where I am needed. I enjoy bringing people together and providing motivation.

Looking forward to gaining some experience on how to be Agile üëü this semester!
