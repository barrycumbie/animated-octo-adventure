<h3>Strengths:
</h3> 
<p>Type nines are usually calm and level headed. They can also difuse arguments easily by taking into account different views.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses:
</h3>
<p>Type nines tend to not speak out very often so their voice is not always heard</p>
<p>So, in a team type nines may not always speak their mind. But when they do, they have well thought-out explanations and thoughts. They can also help the team work better together by disputing conflicts.</p>
